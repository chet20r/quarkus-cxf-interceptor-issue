# cxf-interceptor-issue project

This project is to replicate the issue with registering CXF interceptors with quarkus-cxf plugin.

Details of the issue can be found at --> https://github.com/quarkiverse/quarkus-cxf/issues/121


## Project Structure

This is a multi-module maven project
1. `soap-client` module is a soap webservice client artifacts module that is generated by the cxf plugin
2. `quarkus-service` module which exposes a ReST endpoint and calls the soap service using the client artifacts generated in soap-client 


## How to run

`./mvnw clean compile -pl quarkus-service -am quarkus:dev`

## Problem
There is an interceptor defined called `BasicAuthInterceptor.java`
which is expected to be called during a soap invocation. However, it is not the case.

This project uses Quarkus, the Supersonic Subatomic Java Framework.

## Running the application in dev mode

You can run your application in dev mode that enables live coding using:

```shell script
./mvnw compile quarkus:dev
```

## Packaging and running the application

The application can be packaged using:

```shell script
./mvnw package
```

It produces the `cxf-interceptor-issue-1.0-SNAPSHOT-runner.jar` file in the `/target` directory. Be aware that it’s not
an _über-jar_ as the dependencies are copied into the `target/lib` directory.

If you want to build an _über-jar_, execute the following command:

```shell script
./mvnw package -Dquarkus.package.type=uber-jar
```

The application is now runnable using `java -jar target/cxf-interceptor-issue-1.0-SNAPSHOT-runner.jar`.

## Creating a native executable

You can create a native executable using:

```shell script
./mvnw package -Pnative
```

Or, if you don't have GraalVM installed, you can run the native executable build in a container using:

```shell script
./mvnw package -Pnative -Dquarkus.native.container-build=true
```

You can then execute your native executable with: `./target/cxf-interceptor-issue-1.0-SNAPSHOT-runner`
